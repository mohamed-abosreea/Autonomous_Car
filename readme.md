Welcome to our car control system! Our system is designed with several features to ensure smooth and automated operation. Here's a brief overview:
(1) Starting the car motors using one of two on-board switches.
(2) The car will stop if the other switch is pressed or after one minute has elapsed.
(3) The car moves towards the area with the highest illumination.
(4) Temperature, LDR difference, and elapsed time are displayed on the LCD.
(5) If the car gets closer to an obstacle by a maximum of 10 centimeters, the ultrasonic sensor activates. The car reverses its direction and then rotates by 90 degrees.
